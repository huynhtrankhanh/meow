Contributing to Coq LSP
=======================

Thank you very much for willing to contribute to coq-lsp!

`coq-lsp` has two components:

- a LSP server for Coq project written in OCaml.
- a `coq-lsp` VS Code extension written in TypeScript and React, in
  the `editor/code` directory.

Read coq-lsp [FAQ](etc/FAQ.md) for an explanation on what the above mean.

It is possible to hack only in the server, on the client, or on both at the same
time. We have thus structured this guide in 3 sections: general guidelines,
server, and VS Code client.

## General guidelines

`coq-lsp` is developed in an open-source manner using GitHub.

### Zulip chat

Our main development channel is [hosted at
Zulip](https://coq.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/329642-coq-lsp)
. Please don't hesitate to stop by if you have any questions.

### Code of conduct

All contributors of `coq-lsp` must agree to our [code of
conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### License

`coq-lsp` uses the LGPL 2.1 license, which is compatible with Coq's
license.

### Submitting a contribution, opening an issue.

Please use the github standard interfaces to do so. When you submit a
pull request, you agree to share your code under `coq-lsp` license.

We have a set of tags to classify pull requests and issues, we try to use them
as much as possible. As of today, GitHub requires some permissions for regular
users to be able to manipulate this meta-data, let us know if you need access.

### Changelog

We require an entry in `CHANGES.md` for all changes of relevance; note that as
of today, `CHANGES.md` is the canonical changelog for _both_ the server and the
client.

The client changelog that is used by the VS Code marketplace is at
`editor/code/CHANGELOG.md`, but you should not modify it, as of today we will
generate it from the relevant entries in `CHANGES.md` at release time.

## Server guide

### Compilation

#### Opam/Dune
The server project uses a standard OCaml development setup based on Opam and
Dune.

1. Install the dependencies (the complete updated list of dependencies can be found in `coq-lsp.opam`).

    ```sh
    opam install --deps-only .
    ```

2. Initialize submodules (the `main` branch uses some submodules, which we plan to get rid of soon. Branches `v8.x` can already skip this step.)

    ```sh
    make submodules-init
    ```

3. Compile the server (the `coq-lsp` binary can be found in
`_build/install/default/bin/coq-lsp`).

    ```sh
    make
    ```

Alternatively, you can also use the regular `dune build @check` etc... targets.

#### Nix

We have a Nix flake that you can use.

1. Dependencies: for development it suffices to run `nix develop` to spawn a shell with the corresponding dependencies.

    With the following line you can save the configuration in a Nix profile which will prevent the `nix store gc` from deleting the entries:
    ```
    nix develop --profile nix/profiles/dev
    ```

    You can then use the following line to reuse the previous profile:
    ```
    nix develop nix/profiles/dev
    ```

2. Initialize submodules (the `main` branch uses some submodules, which we plan to get rid of soon. Branches `v8.x` can already skip this step.)

    ```sh
    make submodules-init
    ```

3. Compile the server (the `coq-lsp` binary can be found in
`_build/install/default/bin/coq-lsp`).

    ```sh
    make
    ```

You can view the list of packages and devShells that are exposed
by running `nix flake show`.

If you wish to do `nix build`, you will need to use the `.?submodules=1` trick,
since we use submodules here for vendoring. For example, building requires:

```
nix build .?submodules=1
```

This currently only applies to building the default package (`coq-lsp`), which is
the server. Clients don't have specific submodules as of yet.

### Code organization

The `coq-lsp` server consists of several components, we present them bottom-up

- `vendor/coq-serapi`: [vendored] improved utility functions to handle Coq AST
- `coq`: Utility library / abstracted Coq API. This is the main entry point for
  communication with Coq, and it reifies Coq calls as to present a purely
  functional interface to Coq.
- `fleche`: incremental document processing backend. Exposes a generic API, but
  closely modelled to match LSP
- `lsp`: small generic LSP utilities, at some point to be replaced by a generic
  library
- `controller`: LSP controller, a thin layer translating LSP transport layer to
  `fl√®che` surface API, plus some custom event queues for Coq.
- `controller-js`: LSP controller for Javascript, used for `vscode.dev` and
  jsCoq.

Some tips:

- we much prefer not to address Coq API directly, but always use the `coq`
  library to do it.
- `fleche` has carefully controlled dependencies and code structure due to a)
  having to run in JS, b) targeting other systems in addition to Coq.
- We use [ocamlformat][ocamlformat] to automatically format our codebase. `make
  fmt` will take care of it if your editor is not configured to so
  automatically.

## Releasing

`coq-lsp` is released using `dune-release tag` + `dune-release`.

The checklist for the release as of today is the following:

### Client:

- update the client changelog at `editor/code/CHANGELOG.md`, commit
- for the `main` branch: `dune release tag $coq_lsp_version`
- check with `vsce ls` that the client contents are OK
- `vsce publish`

### Server:

- sync branches for previous Coq versions, using `git merge`, test and push to CI.
- `dune release tag` for each `$coq_lsp_version+$coq_version`
- `dune release` for each version that should to the main opam repos
- [optional] update pre-release packages to coq-opam-archive
- [important] bump `version.ml` and `package.json` version string

## Worker version (and debugging tips)

See https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/issues/410 for debugging
tips with `js_of_ocaml`.

## Client guide (VS Code Extension)

The VS Code extension is setup as a standard `npm` Typescript + React package
using `esbuild` as the bundler. 

### Setup 
1. Navigate to the editor folder
    ```sh
    cd editor/code
    ```
1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm i
    ```

Then there are two ways to work with the VS Code extension: you can let VS Code
itself take care of building it (preferred setup), or you can build it manually.

#### Let VS Code handle building the project
There is nothing to be done, VS Code will build the project automatically when launching the extension. You can skip to [launching the extension](#launch-the-extension). 

#### Manual build
1. Navigate to the editor folder 
    ```sh
    cd editor/code
    ```

You can now run `package.json` scripts the usual way:
- Typecheck the project
    ```sh
    npm run typecheck 
    ```
- Fast dev-transpile (no typecheck) 
    ```sh
    npm run compile
    ```

### Launch the extension

From the toplevel directory launch VS Code using `dune exec -- code -n editor/code`, which will setup the
right environment variables such as `PATH` and `OCAMLPATH`, so the `coq-lsp`
binary can be found by VS Code. If you have installed `coq-lsp` globally, you
don't need `dune exec`, and can just run `code -n editor/code`.

Once in VS Code, you can launch the extension normally using the left "Run and
Debug" panel in Visual Studio Code, or the F5 keybinding.

You can of course install the extension in your `~/.vscode/` folder if so you
desire, although this is not recommended.

### Nix 
In the case of the client we expose a separate shell, `client-vscode`, which can be spawned with the following line (this can be done on top of the original `nix develop`).
```
nix develop .#client-vscode
```


The steps to setup the client are similar to the manual build:
1. Spawn `develop` shell 
    ```sh
    nix develop
    ```
2. Inside `develop`, spawn the `client-vscode` shell 
    ```sh
    nix develop .#client-vscode
    ```
1. Navigate to the editor folder
    ```sh
    cd editor/code
    ```
1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm i
    ```
4. Follow the steps in [manual build](#manual-build).

You are now ready to [launch the extension](#launch-the-extension).

### Code organization
The extension is divided into two main folders:
- `editor/code/src/`: contains the main components,
- `editor/code/views`: contains some webviews components written using React.

### Testing the Web Extension

`coq-lsp` has preliminary support to run as a "Web Extension", to test
that, you want to use the web extension profile in the launch setup.

### Miscellaneous info

- The "Restart Coq LSP server" command will be of great help while developing
  with the server.
- We use [prettier][prettier] to automatically format files in `editor/code`.
  `make ts-fmt` will do this in batch mode.

### Debugging

The default build target will allow you to debug the extension by providing the
right sourcemaps.
